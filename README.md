Familiarity with `C`

Fulltime markdown enjoyer, part time [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) liker (working towrds full time).

Pick up a bit of `mermaid.js`, it'll help you out when your mouse or trackpad dies. The [docs](http://mermaid.js.org/intro/) and [tutorials](http://mermaid.js.org/ecosystem/tutorials.html) are wonderful.

Check out [my website](https://rare-snark.github.io/) for more about me and fun projects.
